Just a simple artillery game, to get me off to a better start with Phaser and
Javascript game programming.
Basics:
Bowman gets 10 shots / round
point is to hit target with 1 of the 10 shots
run out of shots, game over
hit target, continue game
further rounds may have more targets, or 'fences' to shoot over
